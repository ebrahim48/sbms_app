- SBMS Apps is a Flutter application for a Sales and Business Management System. Key features include: user authentication (login, onboarding), product management (product list with search and filtering), order management (create orders with products, quantities, discounts, bonuses), sales tracking (sales order list with detailed invoice information), and user profiles. The app uses GetX for state management, GoRouter for navigation, and connects to a backend API at https://nccl.scanitbd.com. The app has a clean UI with a bottom navigation bar, supports both light/dark themes, and includes proper error handling and loading states. The main screens are Splash, Onboarding, Login, Home (with product list, order creation, sales list, bank features), and Profile screens.
